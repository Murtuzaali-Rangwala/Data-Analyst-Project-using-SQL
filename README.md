# Data Analyst Project: SQL Analysis Using GitHub's DataCharmer Dataset

## Project Overview:

In this project, I performed data analysis on a variety of business-related questions using SQL. The dataset used for this analysis was sourced from the DataCharmer GitHub repository. I used SQL Workbench to execute the queries and extract valuable insights from the database.

## Tools and Technologies:
SQL Workbench: To write and execute SQL queries for data analysis.
GitHub Data (DataCharmer Repository): The dataset contains information on employees, salaries, departments, and more.

## Analysis and Insights:
Employee Distribution: The SQL queries provided insights into employee distribution across departments, helping identify departments with more or fewer employees.
Salary Analysis: By retrieving salary records and calculating averages for departments, this project highlighted salary disparities and helped analyze trends in compensation across different departments.
Gender Diversity: The gender distribution query offered insights into the gender composition across departments, which could inform diversity initiatives.
Employee Tenure: The query that identifies the longest-serving employees provides key insights for workforce planning and recognizing employee loyalty.

## Conclusion:
This project provided valuable insights into employee demographics, department structures, salary trends, and tenure. The findings can guide HR, management, and business leaders in making data-driven decisions regarding employee retention, department growth, and salary planning.
